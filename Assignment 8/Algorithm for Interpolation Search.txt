
    Step 1: In a loop, calculate the value of pos using the above formula.
    Step 2: If it is a match, return the index of the item, and exit.
    Step 3: If the item is less than the element at position pos, calculate the target     position of the left sub-array. Otherwise calculate the same in the right sub-array.
    Step 4: Repeat until a match is found or the search space reduces to zero.
